<h2>Me</h2>
<p>Other material including but not limited to the website and the curriculum interfaces are © Andrew Gilbert Moschou. To be honest, there’s not (yet) much content here that isn’t © ACARA. I’ve basically dumped the Australian Curriculum into a fancy interactive wrapper.</p>
<p>When ACARA has clearly presented an error or an inconsistency and it’s easy to correct, I’ve done so. Sometimes, this is a matter of style. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACARA lists the general capability subelement CCT&nbsp;2.2 twice for ACHASSI160 from Year 7 HASS. I include it once.</li>
<li>Replacing 'straight' quotes with ‘curly’ quotes.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it’s not easy to correct, I don’t. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chinese Background language learner pathway is the only language pathway that has the definite article in the substrand ‘Role of language of culture’ (i.e. ‘<strong>The</strong> role of language and culture’).</li>
</ul>
<p>And if I can’t figure out what ACARA is talking about, I just leave it alone. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Numeracy continuum, at level 2 for the subelement NUM&nbsp;2.1, ACARA writes ‘Level 1e is the starting point for this sub-element’ when actually, it starts at Level 1a.</li>
<li>In the Numeracy continuum, at level 2 for the subelement NUM&nbsp;1.1, it is empty. This is in contrast to everywhere else that has an empty box where they say that the subelement starts somewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that I’ve done a pretty good attempt at connecting different aspects of the Australian Curriculum but there could be errors. Please check the material and judge whether the material here is suitable for your intended purposes yourself.</p>
